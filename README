This is a very simple Pong clone for Linux created in C++. It is mostly a test project for unit-testing in C++ using UnitTest++. It also uses SDL for rendering (just filled rects, no images) as well as SDL_ttf. Not much time has been devoted to making it enjoyable so I can't guarantee high replay value.

To build the game, you need to have make and g++ installed as well as the UnitTest++, SDL, and SDL_ttf development headers and libraries installed. Then download the source and run 

make

from the root directory. This will compile the source and run the unit tests. To run the game, type

./pong

I'd be interested to know if it doesn't build on other Linux systems, so if you run into problems you can e-mail me at a.t.sheehan@gmail.com.

Thanks
